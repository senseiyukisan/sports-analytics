### Data

The data I was working on originates from [transfermarkt.co.uk](https://transfermarkt.co.uk). An almost ready-made dataset and more information on that can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/davidcariboo/player-scores) (This project uses version 70).

### Project

Based on this data and some additional data scraping as well as feature engineering I created an interactive dashboard using [dash](https://dash.plotly.com) and [python](https://www.python.org). The dashboard was then deployed via [heroku](https://heroku.com) and can be seen [here](https://sports-analytics-timwa902.herokuapp.com).
